Write a python script that takes the name of a fasta file from the command line, reads in each sequence, and outputs the reverse complement into a new file. Include comments in the code to explain what each major step is doing. The BioPython tutorial will be VERY useful here (e.g., look up sequence file parsing and reverse complementing sequence objects), as will google.

The first line of your script should be the python "shebang". Look it up to understand what it means. It will look like "#! /usr/bin/env python".

The next lines should import whatever you need from BioPython.

After the shebang line, any other line beginning with "#" will not be seen by the Python interpreter. Use this to add your comments explaining what the script is doing.

The point is not that you should understand how to code complex things in python, but that it is fairly straightforward to cobble together something useful when you have the internet. Steal freely, but not from your classmates (yet).

Upload your final scripts to Canvas.
